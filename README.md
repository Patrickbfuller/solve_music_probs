Use data to make more informed music business decisions!



### Business Understanding 

Indepedent musical artists or any artist with out a data team may have trouble deciding which geographic regions to invest in. If they've got a fan base in one location, who's to say they may not be able to build a fan base somewhere else in the country? But where to start? It's a big country! To help narrow down the options, I suggest starting with locations where similar artists are playing. A region with fans of similar artists will likely be fertile ground for expansion. A model that recommends untapped locations where similar artists have fans, would help provide a starting point for artists to expand.

### Data Understanding

Potential features for gauging similarity of two artists may include, sonic features or genre. For this experiment I will gauge similarity by playlist co-presence. If two artists are appearing in the same playlists together they would be similar. For example: Out of all the playlists that ArtistA appears in, the more ArtistB appears in, the more similar is ArtistB.

For comparing locations, I will use the distance between their geographic coordinates. Because of the curvature of the geographic coordinates, the unique distance computation, known as 'Haversine' will be applied.

### Data Preparation

##### Data Acquisition
For this model I collected the playlists featured in each of the main spotify categories. These include varying concepts such as: 'Rock', 'KPop', 'Sessions', 'Party', 'Mood', 'Pride', etc. I intentionally excluded the categories, 'family', 'comedy', 'word', 'ellen', 'sleep', as the artists will be less correlated with musical concert data. The playlists and artists were collected using a python wrapper for the Spotify API called 'spotipy'. 
With this list of artitst, I also collected their concert locations from 'songkick.com'. To Account for granularity of location naming, I also collected the geographic coordinates for each unique concert location using the Google geocode API with the python package 'googlemaps'.

##### Data Cleaning
I collected the artists and playlists as appearances of artists in each playlist. This made it simple to one-hot encode the playlists. With a resulting flag for presence of the artists in their playlist, I then grouped the data by artist and aggregating the flags, resulting in a row for each artist with a boolean for  each playlist in which they appear. 
For the concerts: I removed any data points older than 2015, and any data for concerts outside of the US. I then merged the geographic coordinates to the concerts. Finally, to help prevent capitilzation errors, all the names of the artists in both tables were coerced to lowercase.

### Modeling


I'll set aside a final validation set of labeled images, maybe 20% for each class. Then I'll use Tensorflow to build an image classifier by fine tuning a pre-trained base model and tf.keras.Sequential. I'll also try using deep feature extraction on the images and making predictions using logistic regression, random forest, etc.

### Evaluation
I will report both the accuracy score and cross entropy loss, on training and test data. Because I don't want to die in the woods, I'll tie the evaluation back to my original business problem and choose classification thresholds that maximize recall for poisonous berries. I plan to use k-fold cross validation to do any needed parameter tuning.

### Deployment
The model will be deployed as a Flask app that can be used to upload a picture of a plant from a mobile phone to get a prediction of its species.
